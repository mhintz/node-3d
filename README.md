# gl-node-3d

Strongly influenced by (read: based on) the ofNode class from openFrameworks, this is essentially a wrapper around some gl-matrix objects that provides convenience functions for manipulating them. The idea is to create a useful representation of a position, orientation, and scale in 3D. This can then be composed into an object alongside vertex data to create a movable, turnable, scalable object in 3D.

I wrote this because I didn't see anything like it already in stack-gl
